Printf()

The printf project is a collaboration between Samson MULANDI and Maryam AZRIA,
actual students of SE at ALX School,
The printf function in C is used to output data to the console or other output devices. Its syntax is:

int printf(const char *format, ...);

The format string specifies the output format, and the optional arguments provide the values to be printed.
The format string can include placeholders for the values, such as %d for integers or %f for floating-point numbers.

The function returns the number of characters printed, or a negative value if an error occurs.
It is part of the standard C library and is declared in the stdio.h header file.
